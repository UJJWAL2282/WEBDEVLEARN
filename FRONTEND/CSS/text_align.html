    <h1> Iron Man</h1>
    <p>   <a href="google.com">Google me</a> Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor 
        Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, 
        and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 
        and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding 
         of the superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually 
         and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.</p>

    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, 
        Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.
        [1] He wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like 
        the character anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, 
        and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. 
        Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict
         in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]</p>
